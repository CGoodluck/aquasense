# AquaSense
The remote environmental Monitoring System

Aquasense is an Aquarium Monitoring Prototype that allows you to continuously track the changes in the water parameters,
notifying the user to the conditions within the tank become too toxic for the fish.

For the past nine months, a colleague has been complaining about the death of all the fish within their aquarium. Consequently,
they find themselves purchasing new fish approximately every 6 weeks. The cause of death is unknown, and the colleague would like 
to determine what are the reason(s) behind these deaths 

Being a dedicated student within the world of technology and computer science, I see this as an opportunity to use the programming, 
software development, and problem-solving skills Iâ€™ve learned throughout my tenor at University. 

Additionally, this solution prototype could be the genesis of a large product used in homes, offices, or industrial complexes to 
monitor Carbon Monoxide, or other environmental hazards. 

Objectives

1.  Determine Conditions necessary to sustain healthy aquatic life
2.  Determine the necessary equipment essential for aquatic life
3.  Create a low-cost sensor system
4.  Create a database to store collected data 
5.  Create an automated system of alerts for hazardous conditions 
6.  Create a system of notifications 
7.  And lastly, use a communication medium to notify the user.
